## Introduction
Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and influenced by various factors. This project focuses on analyzing the price of Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform. Using historical data, we apply statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to understand and predict price trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes historical price data for Solana (SOL). The data can be sourced from various cryptocurrency market platforms such as [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), or other reliable sources.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify patterns and trends.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to understand the data characteristics.
4. **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing and training models to predict future prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models' performance using appropriate metrics.

## Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, variance, etc.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between different variables.

## Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks**
- **Prophet Model**

## Results
The results section will present the findings from both the statistical analyses and machine learning models. This will include visualizations, model performance metrics, and insights derived from the data.
